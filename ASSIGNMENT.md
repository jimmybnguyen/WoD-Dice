# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> To learn this library, I started off by creating examples. By doing so, I can immediately see the results of the functions I used. Using console.log was especially helpful because I got to see how my objects were being manipulated. The README for the library was helpful because it showed me how to use the library. However, there is currently no introduction in the README. This would be the one change I would make to this library because it provides context for the use. It took me some searching to figure out that this library is used for counting the amount of success rolls in a game called World of Darkness. Rolling anything over an 8 adds a success. Rolling a 1 subtracts a sucess. Rolling a 10, the rerollOn number, adds a sucess, and adds one more dice to the pool. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> An effective comment should not go into detail on how the code works, because the code itself should explain that. Rather, comments should explain why this piece of code is here, and any pre-post conditions to help other programmers use and understand the code. This is what raising the level of abstraction means to me. By generalizing how the code works, it allows for more room to consider other ways to write code that does the same thing. However, instead of aiming for a higher level of abstraction with comments, I think we should be focus on achieving an appropriate level of abstraction. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me about ten hours to complete this assignment. I spent much of that time looking at libraries in npm, and researching javascript syntax. 


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I asked Joel for help through Slack. Joel was the one who gave me this library to look at as another potential choice for the assignment. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I definitely underestimated this assignment at the start because I thought commenting would be relatively easy. However, I did not anticipate not being able to understand code that other people have wrote. I spent many hours reading through different libraries, and researching terms like parser and wrapper. For students who are new to JavaScript, or do not have much experience programming, this assignment is much harder than it seems. To improve this assignment, I would like to see examples with different levels of difficulties of reading the code. For me, looking at the examples given was a cognitive overload because there were many things I have never seen before.
